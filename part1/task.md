## BabySoC Fundamentals and Functional Modelling

## Objective
The goal of this assignment is to build a solid understanding of System-on-Chip (SoC) fundamentals and practice functional modelling of the BabySoC using simulation tools such as Icarus Verilog and GTKWave.

## System-on-Chip (SoC) :
A System-on-Chip (SoC) is an integrated circuit that combines most or all of the essential components of a computer or electronic system onto a single microchip, such as the CPU, memory, input/output interfaces, and sometimes peripherals like GPUs and wireless connectivity modules. This integration leads to greater power efficiency, smaller device size, and improved speed, making SoCs central to technologies like smartphones, tablets, and wearables.

## Components of a Typical SoC
- **Central Processing Unit (CPU):**
The CPU is the brain of the SoC, responsible for executing instructions and managing overall system operations. An SoC can have one or multiple cores, including microcontrollers, microprocessors, or specialized processors like DSPs (Digital Signal Processors). CPUs handle the main computation tasks and control other components.

- **Memory:**
SoCs include different types of memory necessary for data storage and access:

    - RAM (Random Access Memory): Temporary data storage for active processes, often subdivided into SRAM (fast, expensive) and DRAM (slower, cheaper).

    - ROM (Read-Only Memory): Stores firmware and essential startup instructions.

    - Cache memory is used to speed up data access to the CPU cores by keeping frequently used data nearby.

- **Graphics Processing Unit (GPU):**
The GPU accelerates rendering of images, videos, and animations, essential for graphical user interfaces, gaming, and multimedia applications. It takes over these intensive tasks from the CPU to improve performance and efficiency.

- **Digital Signal Processor (DSP):**
Specializes in real-time signal processing tasks like audio, speech, video, and sensor data processing. It is optimized for mathematical computations on streams of data, common in multimedia and communication SoCs.

- **Input/Output (I/O) Interfaces:**
These interfaces manage communication between the SoC and external devices. Common interfaces include USB, HDMI, Ethernet, SPI, UART, and GPIO pins. They facilitate data transfer and peripheral control.

- **Connectivity Modules:**
Modern SoCs often integrate wireless communication modules such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, NFC, and cellular modems. These modules enable the device to connect to networks and other devices wirelessly.

- **Power Management Unit (PMU):**
The PMU regulates and optimizes power consumption across the SoC components, essential for battery-operated devices. It implements techniques like dynamic voltage and frequency scaling to save power during low activity.

- **Security Features:**
Integrated security components such as encryption engines, secure boot, hardware-based access control, and tamper detection provide protection against unauthorized access, ensuring data safety and system integrity.

- **Peripherals and Other Blocks:**
Additional blocks include timers, analog-to-digital converters (ADC), digital-to-analog converters (DAC), oscillators, voltage regulators, and watchdog timers. These serve specific control functions and support the SoC's interaction with the physical environment.

##  BabySoC:
The BabySoC is designed as a teaching tool and provides a simplified abstraction of a real-world SoC, allowing students and beginners to grasp SoC architecture principles without the complexity and scale of actual commercial systems. It reduces the number of components and interconnections to focus attention on fundamental concepts like CPU-memory-peripheral communication and basic functional modeling, making it ideal for simulation-based learning.
## The Role of Functional Modelling:
Functional modeling is an early design step that captures the high-level behavior of the SoC, focusing on what the system should do rather than how it will be implemented in hardware. It abstracts the main functions and interactions without going into low-level timing or gate details. This model helps verify system functionality, identify design issues, and explore architectural choices early.

After functional modeling, design moves to RTL (Register Transfer Level) where detailed cycle-accurate hardware behavior is described using HDLs like Verilog or VHDL. Physical design then translates RTL into a layout on silicon, considering placement, routing, and timing.

Functional modeling reduces risk and development time by enabling early validation through simulation before committing to RTL coding and costly fabrication steps.
